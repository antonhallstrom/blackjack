Blackjack 

You can place bets, there a preset of
min and max-intevals.

low or high bets.

When you lose your hand, you lose your bet, but if you win
with your hand, you will get your bet x 2.

52 cards.

- All dressed cards have a value of 10.
- Ace is 1 || 11
- 2 - 10 are there values.

There are more tens in the deck.

Your turn, after placing bets,
you can draw a new card or stop.

if stop dealer revealse his hidden card.

if draw acard, and you are not fat, 21.
Then you can do that option again.

om man får 21 direkt så vinner man, får dealr också 21 
så oavgjort.

21 you lose.

Dealern har inget val.

What I need to solve.

A deck that shuffles. And then begin able to draw
a card.


// If dealer has value 17 or over, dealer stop draw. and calc.

// Split can only be made if player has equal values, like 
// 2 5s or 2 10s,
// Cant get blackjack on split, only accures on the 2 originla cards.
// Split on ace, only one card.
// Only one split per sesssion.
// Insurance, will be offred if dealers opening card is Ace.

// Busting.

// If it is the same its conciderd a push, and money stays the same.

If blackjack, 21, you cant lose, and you will get payd 3 to 1
1.5 * your bet.

// You lose if the dealer gets a black jack and you dont.
// Insurance bet pays 2-1,  Can only bet half of what your original bet is
// If dealer do not have a blackjack you lose your insurance bet.

Add in, 1 and 5, beacuse when splitting values.
